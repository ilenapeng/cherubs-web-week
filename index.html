      <p>Callaway Palk was at work when she found out her cherub roommate was from China. She became so excited that her boss asked her what was wrong.</p>
<p>“I got so excited and I started screaming ‘Oh my goodness, my roommate’s from China,’” Palk said.</p>
<p>Palk, from Tennessee, arrived at the dorms with six suitcases along. Li brought one.</p>
<p>Palk calls her mother and sister four or five times per day. Li calls her mother four or five times a month.</p>
<p>Palk likes fashion writing. Li likes investigative journalism.</p>
<p>Li goes to sleep at around 2 or 3 a.m., while Palk sleeps at 10:30 p.m., a time that Li considers amazingly early.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing,” Li said, referencing Palk’s bedtime. “She’s there living a healthy life while I’m wrecking my body.”</p>
<p>But despite their differences, they get along well. After hanging up on the phone with their parents, both roommates always share what they had talked about during the call. From Li’s dislike of bugs to Palk’s kindergarten boyfriend, Li said they talk about everything.</p>
<p>“Even though the two of us are very, very different and the cultures that we come from are different, it still works,” Li said.</p>

      <p>The first detail Danny Vesurai noticed when he looked at his door was that his roommate’s name was Daniel. Despite the similar name, the two are from very different places — Vesurai lives in the Silicon Valley, while Daniel Hahm is from Seoul.</p>
<p>Vesurai said he discovered that students in both places are similar in that they study hard and also party hard.</p>
<p>“Korea seems more extreme, but ultimately, it’s the same,” Vesurai said. “People aren’t all that different.”</p>
<p>Hahm learned that turning off his roommate’s alarm is a bad idea. If he does, Hahm said Vesurai won’t wake up. So instead, Hahm shouts “Danny, Danny, Danny” to wake Vesurai up when the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>“In the morning one of our alarm goes off and we both wake up and glare at each other to turn it off,” Vesurai said.</p>
<p>“Whenever I walk into the room I always want to see Danny in the room but he’s never there,” Hahm said. “That’s always disappointing.”</p>
<p>Vesurai said that he’s really happy to have Hahm as his roommate. Despite being in different friend groups, Vesurai said that it’s easy to spend time with Hahm.</p>
<p>“I know if I want to talk to him about anything or get advice or just chill, he’ll be open to that,” Vesurai said. “I’m not a naturally talkative person and he gets that and respects that. I think we just click.”</p>
<p>Hahm adds on that he hopes they'll stay in touch even after cherubs.</p>
<p>“We have the best boy roommate relationship,” Hahm said.</p>

      <p>After arriving at cherubs, Mona Murhamer waved “goodbye” to her mom, who needed to catch a flight to Sweden to visit her family. Coincidentally, Murhamer’s roommate, Tiffany Fahlnaes, is also from Sweden.</p>
<p>“When we did the roommate story, she told me that sitting in a common area and sharing experiences with a group of people was a new experience,” Murhamer said. “Tiffany said that people in Sweden are more reserved and don’t speak as freely as we do.”</p>
<p>But it’s not just american mannerisms that Fahlnaes was unfamiliar with. She found that although the food wasn’t a drastic change, it was sweeter and fatter. When she watched a live recording of NPR’s “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me” with the other cherubs, she also found herself unfamiliar with some of the pop culture references, like the repeated references to Grouper Week.</p>
<p>“I’m in a whole new culture, so for me, everything is kind of new,” Fahlnaes said. “But it feels very natural and comfortable with Mona.”</p>
